# Advent of Code 2021

This year we will work on the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)
challenges together. Join us on the [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/305975-Advent-of.20Code) and in a [Zoom meeting](https://aalto.zoom.us/j/62247607160?pwd=dU1KdFFmOWZrNkk4U1c1RHpzYnU2Zz09) each Tuesday from 14 to 17 CET, or 15 to 18 EET (Meeting ID: 697 4843 1728).

The advent of code is a great way to learn a new programming language tohether
or brush up your software development skills. Each week we will chat about our
solutions, give some tips if you are stuck (provided at least one of us has
solved the problem) and just chat and have some fun.

See you on the [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/305975-Advent-of.20Code) and in the Zoom meeting.
